# thumper

> A customized version of bootstrap with customized for use with Go Nimbly projects and extended with new custom component styles.

### Features

✓ Subjectively better looking than bootstrap!
✓ Scoped version for inclusion in environments that already have css we don't want to override.
✓ Webpackable js or css
✓ Sourcemaps
✓ Only one file to include
✓ Font Awesome optional

### Installation: Webpack project

```bash
npm install @gonimbly/thumper --save-dev
```

If you're using webpack then you can add `import 'thumper'` or `require('thumper')` to your project but you will also need a style-loader entry in your webpack config.

If you would like to use [Font Awesome](http://fontawesome.io/) icons in your project then add the latest [cdn link](https://www.bootstrapcdn.com/fontawesome/) or install via npm.
